# Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

### Project Overview
The Category Manager for Chips wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region. I seek to:
- Analyze transaction and customer data to identify trends and inconsistencies. 
- Develop metrics and examine sales drivers to gain insights into overall sales performance. 
- Create visualizations and prepare findings to formulate a clear recommendation for the client's strategy.
  
The insights from the analysis will feed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

### Data Sources

Customer Data: This is the "QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv" file. It is the dataset containing detailed information about the different types of customers that patronized the company, the customers are categorized considering two factors: Life Stages and premium customers. 

Transaction Data: This is the "QVI_transaction_data.csv" file. It is the dataset containing detailed information about the purchase by each customer.

Data: This is the "QVI_data.csv" file. it is the combination of the Customer data and Transaction data after performing Data cleaning on both datasets 

### Tools Used
- Jupyter notebook
- R programming

### Data Preparation
In the initial Data preparation, i perfomed the following task:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handled missing values and outliers
3. Data cleaning and formatting
4. Merge the Customer data and Transaction Data

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Now that the data is ready for analysis, I can define some metrics of interest to the client:
- Who spends the most on chips(total sales)?
- Describing customers by lifestage and how premium their general purchasing behaviour is?
- How many customers are in each segment?
- How many chips are bought per customer by segment?
- What’s the average chip price by customer segment?

### Data Analysis
